A lot of Hackathons tend to run workshops, which can be helpful if it's your
first time programming or what to try something new.

Common Workshops:

* Introduction to Git
* Basic Python Programming
* Making your first website

MLH Member Events will run a [BlackRock-branded Capture the Flag](https://localhost.mlh.io/#activities).
MLH events may also do something from this [list](https://localhost.mlh.io/#activities) if asked.

## Topics/Tools to look at

The best things to look at depend on your skill level. No point trying to do
something either really below your skill level or something way beyond it.

You'll get the best experience with a Hackathon if you try and learn something
new!

### Beginner

If you are just learning programming for the first time, making a simple website
is a great thing to try.

Otherwise, there are tools like [Processing](https://processing.org/) and it's
Javascript counterpart [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which are great for making
visual projects.

Python has many good libraries available if you are trying to process some data
from a website. Data sources will tend to provide JSON data which Python can
handle very well! Otherwise Javascript with Node is also very suitable for this
task.

Mashing up two APIs creatively is one of the best projects you can do. For
example, displaying crime data from [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/)
over a map.

### Intermediate

Machine Learning projects are common for a good reason!

Mobile development is popular, with many good tool options available. You can
either use the Standard Android Studio or XCode if you plan on using
Java/Kotlin/Swift or try something like React-Native if you prefer JavaScript.

Making a game is always a good project, expecially if you are in a team as it
makes it simple to split up the work and even better if you have a non-technical
team member as they can help make assets.

Common environments used include:

* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - A free and open source game engine.
* [Unity](https://unity.com/) - Free for non commerical use and very popular
with indie developers and industry. 
* [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) - Very big in industry
and free for small studios.
* [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) - Common with Indie
developers but does money.


### Advanced

You probably already have some idea of what you are interested in doing, but
looking at things you aren't familiar with is probably the best use of a
Hackathon for you!

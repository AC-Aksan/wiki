Fund raising is one of the most stressful parts of organising, so organisers
would really love your help!

## Why Sponsor?

Hackathons are a great way to:

* Recruit dedicated students looking for placement opportunities or graduate
jobs
* Get feedback from developers on the usability of your developer oriented
products
* Improve brand recognition with developers

## Who to Sponsor

Check out list of [upcoming events](events/upcoming/) for a list of ones we are
keeping track of, otherwise check out what hackathons are being mentioned on
the [Hackathon Hackers EU facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackerseu/)
and also Eventbrite.

## How to Sponsor

Contact any organiser and they'll be happy to send you a sponsorship prospectus
, so you can see the tiers they are offering.

Organisers tend to be pretty open to alternative options, so if you can provide
food, swag, mentors or even a venue it will be appreciated.

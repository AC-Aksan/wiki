## Finding Events

MLH publishes the list of the Hackathons they are working with
[here](https://mlh.io/seasons/eu-2020/events).

Events are normally advertised on
[Hackathon Hackers EU](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackerseu/)

Some events might be listed on Eventbrite, but not every event uses it for
tickets.

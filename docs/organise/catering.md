# Catering

## Distribution

For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing 
with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their 
wristbands (Like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack).

For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets
emptied works.

## What to get

It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands
over things like curries.

It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between
dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard
to do if you are tight on money.

Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments
on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!)

### Main Meals

#### Food Trucks

You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event.

Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of
a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive.

The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months
it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long.

#### Dominos

Everyone love pizza.

Can be quite expensive. Cost quoted to CovHack was £8 per large pizza.

Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue.

The Vegan pizza is not well liked.

#### Papa John's

The Vegan pizza is generally much better received compared to Dominos.

#### Subway Platters

Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch
might need run later.

Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies
etc.

It's about £18-£20 per plater, which some volume discounts.

#### McDonalds

Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with
hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order
pretty close to the event (handy if you get funding late)

CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack
has had it most years.


#### Zizzis

Offers a good vegan pizza and has a whole menu for [dietary requirements](https://www.zizzi.co.uk/data/menus/static_menus/1/pdf/autumn19-allergen-menu-tab-web.pdf)

#### Breakfast

Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco and picking up various things is what tends to
work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended.

### Snacks

Usual costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, crisps, etc.

## Dietary Requirements

Make sure you cater for people with dietary requirements first! This reduces
issues related to cross-contamination.

It's potentially worth sending an email about what you are serving beforehand
to find out issues beforehand. 

You should keep note of who has requirements that can't be covered by your
normal food sources and also **maintain a list of places that can cover all the
common requirements** so attendees do not have to wait for several hours.

Some common requirements to have are:

* Vegetarians
* Pescatarians
* Vegans
* Gluten Free
* Lactose intolerance
* Religious Requirements
* Allergies

Some sites that had relatively good information on these:

* <https://www.comtix.com/blog/7-dietary-restrictions-every-event-planner-aware/>

### Vegetarians

Vegetarians are fairly easy to handle. Most places will offer vegetarian
options at the same cost of normal options.

Worth considering is that some vegetarians don't consume eggs (some religious
requirements cover this)

### Pescatarians

As you generally do not serve fish at hackathons, Pescatarians can be handled
the same way as Vegetarians.

### Vegans

Vegans do not consume animal products, which means even a lot of vegetarian
options aren't suitable.

You can either structure your vegetarian food to be vegan, or get arrange it
separr

### Gluten Free

Some people suffer from various conditions that mean they can not consume
gluten, which covers protein found in wheat, barley, rye and oats.

A lot of places will offer food that is gluten free nowadays, but you have to
check with everyone.

### Lactose Intolerance

Not being able to consume diary effects a lot of options. Most chains will
cover it though.

Remember, eggs aren't diary so they can be part of options for this.

### Religious Requirements

Events normally cover religious requirements like Halal/Kosher with vegetarian
options, but if you can offer it it would probably be appreciated.

### Allergies

Allergies can be quite hard to handle due to how variable they can be. You'll
have to ask attendees when they register and when they arrive so you can
accommodate this.

You can find some information on the [NHSs website covering common ones](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/)

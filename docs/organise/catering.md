# Catering

## Distribution

For main meals, you'll need to sort of people with dietary requirements first.

You might need to keep people to only having one portion if you are dealing 
with certain businesses. This can be done with either a tick mark on their 
wristbands (Like HackSheffield) or a card (like StudentHack).

For snacks, having a table and periodically adding new things to it as it gets
emptied works.

## What to get

It tends to be preferable to get food the hackers can eat with their hands
over things like curries.

It's generally recommended to have some food at midnight as the time between
dinner and Breakfast is quite long. But budget-wise, this can be quite hard
to do if you are tight on money.

Just some experiences and comments on various places. (We do appreciate comments
on smaller businesses as well as other events nearby benefit!)

### Main Meals

#### Food Trucks

You might find nearby food trucks capable of serving your event.

Food can be higher quality than the normal franchise and give attendees more of
a choice, but does tend to be a bit more expensive.

The queues can be quite long, and if they setup outside in the colder months
it might be bit too cold for attendees to stand outside for too long.

#### Dominos

Everyone love pizza.

Can be quite expensive. Cost quoted to CovHack was £8 per large pizza.

Need to get a good balance. Over buying Margarita tends to be an issue.

#### Subway Platters

Generally goes down well. They tend to need a lot of time to prepare, so lunch
might need run later.

Really good option for vegetarians! And they provide sheets regarding allergies
etc.

It's about £18-£20 per plater, which some volume discounts.

#### McDonalds

Very good for large orders and very well priced. Tends to go down well with
hackers. Decent for vegetarians, if a little boring. They can take the order
pretty close to the event (handy if you get funding late)

CovHack had a really good experience with our local franchise and AstonHack
has had it most years.

#### Breakfast

Heading to an Aldi/Lidl/Costco and picking up various things is what tends to
work best. Breakfast never tends to be too well attended.

### Snacks

Usual costco stuff works well. Various soft drinks, crisps, etc.

## Dietary Requirements

Catering for Vegetarians (and possibly vegans) can normally do done via
whatever company is supplying for food.

More difficult requirements, e.g gluten free (for people with Celiac's disease)
or accounting for certain allergies, often require more work.

The general standard practice is to ask attendees during the event if they have
these requirements (And also ask in your ticket form) and then go out to a
nearby store or order something in for them off something like justeat.

It's quite hard to rely on just information provided on your ticket form as
sometimes people forget and also due to hackathons having a fairly high drop
out rate. So often the best option is just to ask on the day and sort it out
then. If your event is large enough, you can probably account for it as the
ratio of attendees with the requirement might be pretty static, but then you
are getting into the 300+ attendee range.

If possible, it's much nicer to offer halal/kosher food other than just
straight vegetarian food but it is harder to manage.

Be careful about nuts as they are a common allergy, and often people can have
quite severe reactions.

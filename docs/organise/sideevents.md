## Code Golf

The manchester js code golf server is pretty good, but requires uploading a
file instead of editing it in the browser.

You will need to write extra challenges as the built-in ones aren't very good.

CovHack has a dockerised fork [here](https://github.com/CovHackSoc/mancjs-code-golf)
for easing your deploys.

## Code in the Dark

Basically, recreate a website without out previewing your code.

Under MLH events this goes as `!light`.

[@baahorn](https://twitter.com/baahorn) forked MLHs service for CovHack and
removed MLH branding (a licence requirement) and the dependency on MyMLH.

Otherwise, you can use the [editor here](https://github.com/codeinthedark/codeinthedark.github.io)
and use a google drive folder for uploads.

## Budget

Things to consider:

* Not everyone is present at every meal.
* Most hackathons have an attrition rate of 30-50%.
* Try and have some money put aside for on the day emergencies.

preferably in an open format!

You can find CovHack 2019s budget [here](/static/documents/budgets/covhack-2019-budget.ods).
We were a 60 person event.

MLH provides a template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit#gid=1863528508)
but it over estimates a lot, including assuming a 500 person attendance.

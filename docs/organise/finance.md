## Budget


### Examples

Feel free to publish yours here! Either as a link or upload it to the repo,
preferable in an open format!

You can find CovHack 2019s budget [here](/static/documents/budgets/covhack-2019-budget.ods).
We were a 60 person event.

MLH provides a template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit#gid=1863528508)
but it over estimates a lot, including assuming a 500 person attendance.

## Sponsorship

### Prospectus 
You need to write a sponsorship prospectus. You can find tons of examples in 
the [MLHs repository](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-organizer-guide/tree/master/Organizer-Resources/Previous-Sponsorship-Decks)

The DurHack19 Sponsorship Deck can be found [here](/static/documents/decks/DH19SponsorshipDeck.pdf)

### Finding Sponsors
Unfortunately the best way to get sponsorship is to 'cold email' as many companies as possible. Remember to try and tailor the initial email to the company and to think about what that company will want to get out of the hackathon, a local startup will want something very different to Microsoft.

A good tool to keep track of all the potential sponsors is a CRM, e.g. hubspot, you can add contacts to it as well as set up a sponsorship pipeline.

### Contracts

An example contract with terms removed can be seen [here](/static/documents/contracts/Example.odt).

Many Student Unions have a legal depertment dedicated to writing, amending, approving and enforcing contracts.
It's always nice to have the SU have your back in the unlikely case of a rougue sponsor.

The Manchester Computer Science society has a [public script](https://github.com/unicsmcr/contract_generator)
for doing contract generation based on templates, which might be helpful if
you are doing a lot.

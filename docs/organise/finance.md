## Budget


### Examples

Feel free to publish yours here! Either as a link or upload it to the repo,
preferable in an open format!

You can find CovHack 2019s budget [here](/static/documents/budgets/covhack-2019-budget.ods).
We were a 60 person event.

MLH provides a template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit#gid=1863528508)
but it over estimates a lot, including assuming a 500 person attendance.

## Sponsorship

### Prospectus 
You need to write a sponsorship prospectus. You can find tons of examples in 
the [MLHs repository](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-organizer-guide/tree/master/Organizer-Resources/Previous-Sponsorship-Decks)

The DurHack19 Sponosrship Deck can be found [here](/static/documents/decks/DH19SponsorshipDeck.pdf)
### Contracts

An example contract with terms removed can be seen [here](/static/documents/contracts/Example.odt).

Many Student Unions have a legal depertment dedicated to writing, amending, approving and enforcing contracts.
It's always nice to have the SU have your back in the unlikely case of a rougue sponsor.

The Manchester Computer Science society has a [public script](https://github.com/unicsmcr/contract_generator)
for doing contract generation based on templates, which might be helpful if
you are doing a lot.

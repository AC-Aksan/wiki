## Stickers

Hackers love stickers! If you're designing your own stickers there are community 'standards' for sizing (particularly important if you want to make a hex sticker) these can be found [here](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickersStandard).

### Sticker Providers
Most hackathons tend to get stickers from StickerMule, if you're a MLH affiliated event then you can get credit from them, if you're not you can still ask (some hackathons have had success with this).

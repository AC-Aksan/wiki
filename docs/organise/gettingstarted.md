### So your interested with getting on the hackathon scene?
#### Where to start
##### Recurring new Hackathon
If it is a continuing hackathon, grab the statistics from the most recent hackathon, and work of the pros and cons from the last to create a skeleton for the next one
##### Brand new hackathon
Make sure you have an organising team ready. MLH does have a massive documentation with how to organise a hack within a year

#### Hackathon Organising Team
Make sure that it is a team of at least 5-6 and more depending on the size and location of the hackathon.

#### Finance
If its a recurring hackathon, review the old finance and determine the budget you wish to have.

For new hackathons, creating a budget can be hard to start. These would be some stuff you wish to start off with:

* Food & Snacks
* Prizes, if your providing your onw
* General amenities (Plates, Cutlery, Cords, etc...)

Once done, check with the number of sponsors you wish to have. More info on Sponsorship Tiers

#### Hackathon Size
Usually MLH generally allow hackathons within 150-200 attendees and more. Think how much attendees you want to get. Make sure where your hosting the hackathon can appropriately handle that much attendees. Factor in as well the amount of Sponsors coming on site.

#### Sponsorship Tiers
This is a core element of the hackathon budget as well as how the hackathon runs. Having different tiers can provide different addons of what a sponsor can do within the hackathon.

Most hackathons have at least 3 different tiers which is a common trend between different hackathons.

_Note: This is a sample tier system with addons._

###### _Top Tier_
This is the best tier which will provide the most amount of abilities in the hackathon. General hackathon abilites may include:

* 2+ Workshops
* Abilitiy to come to the hackathon
* Social Media Presence
* Judging Panel
* Tier Price can be at least 1/3 to 40% of the hackathon budget

Tips: For first time hackathons, best to have up to 2 if possible.

##### _Mid Tier_
This is the most common tier which will provide the stable amount of abilities within the hackathon. General hackathon abilites may include:

* Abilitiy to come to the hackathon
* 1 Workshop
* Social Media Presence
* Judging Panel
* Tier Price can be at least 25% of the hackathon budget

Tips: For first time hackathons, best to have up to 1 if possible.

##### _Low Tier_
This is the beginning tier which will provide the stable amount of abilities within the hackathon. General hackathon abilites may include:

* Social Media Presence
* Tier Price can be at least 10-20% of the hackathon budget

Tips: For first time hackathons, best to have more than 2 if possible. You can also have no low tier sponsors but it's advised to have a couple.

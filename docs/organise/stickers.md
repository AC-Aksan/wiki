## Stickers

Hackers love stickers! If you're designing your own stickers there are community 'standards' for sizing (particularly important if you want to make a hex sticker) these can be found [here](https://github.com/terinjokes/StickersStandard).

### Sticker Providers
Most hackathons tend to get stickers from StickerMule, if you're a MLH affiliated event then you can get credit from them, if you're not you can still ask (some hackathons have had success with this).

### Companies that will send stickers
*MLH - If you're affiliated with MLH then the coach will bring loads of stickers
*JetBrains - Some hackathons have had success with JetBrains, you can contact them [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/support)
*Monzo - Some hackathons have had success with Monzo. One contact is press@monzo.com

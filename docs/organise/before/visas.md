You might get a request to provide a letter of invitation (LOI) for a hacker who needs a visa.

## Handling

Most events except large ones don't try to handle this as it can be quite lot of hassle and risk.

If you do intend to offer this, you need to consider the following:

* Have an earlier closing date for signups for those who require Visa. This ensures they have plenty of time to apply for the visa and find cheap transport. (2-3 months before was suggested).
* Verify their student status properly (if you are student hackathon).

This is much easier to handle if your event is application only.

There have been suggestions of asking for proof of transport, etc.

There is potentially some risk if they arrive in the country but don't go to your event, which is why some events will only confirm them having a ticket and not issue a full invitation.

## Example of a supporting document

The template used for HackTheMidlands is the following:

```
To whom it may concern, 

We are pleased to confirm that <NAME> is in possession of a ticket for  our <EVENT NAME> event, which will be hosted on <DATE> at the following address,

<YOUR VENUE ADDRESS>

The event will run from <START TIME> until <END TIME>.
```

This only confirms they have a ticket and not a formal invitation.
